<h3>Project structure</h3>
<p>The top-level directory contains the following subdirectories:</p>
<ul>
<li>bmips-le:   precompiled programs for little-endian MIPS I; directly runnable by CSPIM</li>
<li>bmips-be:   precompiled programs for big-endian MIPS I; directly runnable by CSPIM</li>
<li>hostapps:   host utilities [the interpreter itself]</li>
<li>mipsapps:   source fof programs runnable by CSPIM; precompiled in both <code>bmips-le</code> and <code>bmips-be</code></li>
<li>vm:         core simulator: MIPS instruction set and ELF loader</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to build</h3>
<p>This package has been developed and tested with Solaris cc, gcc and Visual
Studio 2008, and macOS (excluding cross-compilation of mipsapps).  Prerequisites for building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working native compiler.  Solaris cc, gcc, and Visual Studio 2008 have been
tested.</li>
<li>Working cross-compiler which can generate little-endian or big-endian MIPS I
ELF executables (for MIPS apps).  gcc 4.2.4 and binutils 2.22 have been tested.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpreter is built by executing</p>
<pre><code>cmake .
make</code></pre>
<p>This will build host applicactions in <code>hostapps</code>. By default, MIPS applications in
<code>mipsapps</code> are not built, since they require a cross compiler. Directories <code>bmips-le</code> and <code>bmips-be</code>
contain pre-built binaries of the sources in <code>mipsapps</code>.</p>
<p>To build them for yourself, specify <code>-DSKIP_APPS=OFF</code> when invoking <code>cmake</code>.</p>
<h5>CMake options</h5>
<pre><code>MIPS_BE     Build all for big endian MIPS target.
SKIP_APPS   Skip building mips apps in mipsapps. Use this when you don't have a cross compiler.
VIRTUALIZED Build for use with load/run lvl1. Doesn't yet support big endian (MIPS_BE will be error).
SKIP_SSTEP  Skip building sstep, which uses POSIX librt. Use this on macOS.</code></pre>
<h4>Host applications</h4>
<p>The following applications are built in <code>hostapps</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>runtorture</code>: use to run the MIPS torture test</li>
<li><code>run</code>:          use to run (possibly encrypted) MIPS executables</li>
<li><code>runbench</code>:   use to run the MIPS benchmarks</li>
<li><code>elfcrpyt</code>:   use to encrypt MIPS ELF executables</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sstep</code>, <code>hanoi-bench-native</code>, <code>mmult-bench-native</code> are benchmarking
applications; see the above paper for details.  The "run" programs
take as parameter a MIPS ELF executable; an example invocation is
    ./hostapps/run ./mipsapps/hanoi
<code>runtorture</code> should only be used to run the <code>cputorture</code> program.</p>
<h4>MIPS CPU torture test</h4>
<p>Torture test assembly source is generated by preprocessing the <code>*.sm4</code> files
with M4:</p>
<pre><code>m4 cputorture.sm4 &gt; cputorture.s</code></pre>
<p>Endian-specific versions of loadstore.sm4 exist to support building cputorture.s
for both CPU variants.</p>
<p>The pregenerated source is already provided in the distribution.  The test
is run by executing</p>
<pre><code>./hostapps/runtorture ./mipsapps/cputorture</code></pre>
<p>If the test is successfully passed, the last lines of the output will be
something like (note the <code>(near SUCCESS)</code> in the last line):</p>
<pre><code>finished: exception=5, code=0x0, last_branch=0x2e74(near t_link)

(near SUCCESS)</code></pre>
<p>If the execution stops at a label name other than <code>SUCCESS</code> in the last line,
something has gone wrong and the preceding output can be determined to find
out what.</p>
<h4>MIPS applications</h4>
<p>Many of the other example problems are are solved assignments (in C) from
Appendix of the third edition of Hennessy &amp; Patterson, Computer Organization
and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface; available at.  This appendix is
also available online <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/HP_AppA.pdf">here.</a>
These programs should be executed with <code>./hostapps/run program</code>.</p>
<p>As expected, mipsapps built for big endian will only work with hostapps built
to run big endian executables (<code>-DMIPS_BE</code>).</p>
<h4>Encrypted execution</h4>
<p>All LOAD ELF segments of executables can be encrypted with RC-5 encryption
algorithm using 32-bit block size and 128-bit key.  The encryption uses ECB
mode, which should <em>not be used for anything but simple demos</em>!  Example
session:</p>
<pre><code>./hostapps/elfcrypt mipsapps/hanoi /tmp/hanoi-crypt 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
./hostapps/run /tmp/hanoi-crypt 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF</code></pre>
<p>Failing to provide the key in the last command will terminate execution with
exception 3 (invalid instruction).</p>
<p>Big endian MIPS is currently unsupported in this mode.</p>
<h4>Self-simulation</h4>
<p>Compile both hosted and VIRTUALIZED build (configure this by using <code>ccmake</code>).
This must be done in two separate build directories; note that cmake supports
builds in directories other than the source directory (so-called
"out-of-source build").  This builds an extra executable,
<code>./mipsapps/run-lvl1</code>, which should be run with <code>./hostapps/load-lvl1</code>.
<code>./run-lvl1</code> can currently only run cputorture, since the nested simulation
does not yet forward system calls to the outer simulation.</p>
<p>NOTE: You need to remove all files previously generated by CMake for
out-of-source build to work.</p>
<p>Suppose that the hosted interpreter has been built in the <code>./HH</code> directory,
and the non-hosted in the <code>./NH</code> directory.  Then the CPU torture test can
be run in the nested simulation with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>./HH/hostapps/load-lvl1 ./NH/mipsapps/run-lvl1 ./NH/mipsapps/cputorture </code></pre>
<p>Big endian MIPS is currently unsupported.</p>
<h4>Building cross-gcc</h4>
<p>Note that gcc 4.2.x is the highest gcc version that doesn't require GMP, MPFR
and MPC libraries, which significantly eases installation.</p>
<p>For a big-endian cross compiler, replace <code>mipsel-elf</code> with <code>mips-elf</code> below.</p>
<p>Note: building gcc 4.2.x with a modern version of gcc is tough. It helps to set
languages to C only, and to disable Werror when parameterizing GNU's <code>configure</code>
script.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and build binutils (tested with version 2.22).
Configure and build as:</p>
<p><code>./configure --prefix=$HOME --disable-debug --disable-nls --target=mipsel-elf</code>
<code>make install</code></p></li>
<li><p>Download and build gcc; it MUST NOT be built in the source dir (hence ../).
Make sure that the installed binutils (mipsel-elf-as etc.) are in PATH.</p>
<p><code>../gcc-4.2.4/configure --prefix=$HOME --disable-debug --disable-nls --target=mipsel-elf --disable-bootstrap --disable-libssp</code></p>
<p><code>make install</code></p></li>
</ol>
